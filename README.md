# Genius Knockoff 🎮

Genius Knockoff is a project that clones the fuctionalities of the [Genius toy](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(jogo)). Our GUI is composed primarily of graphical resources inspired by an reimagination of an old PARC interface.

> This project is a Digital Innovation One challenge.

# Development

We use node version 7.21.0

`nvm install 7.21.0`

`nvm use 7.21.0`

The first time, you will need to run  

`npm install`

Then just start the application with

For a better experience, use Google Chrome.
